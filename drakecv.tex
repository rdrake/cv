	I am responding to your \href{http://hr.uoit.ca/working_at_uoit/career-opportunities/administrative-and-technicial/External/faculty-of-science---computing-laboratory-technician---uoit-13-390.php}{external job posting} for the position of Computing Laboratory Technician in the Faculty of Science (competition \textbf{\ucsc{UOIT 13-390}}).
	
	I am a motivated, driven, and responsible individual who is excited about new technology and always trying out new technologies.  I am intimately familiar with the existing computer science curriculum at \ucsc{UOIT}, having both graduated from the Computing Science program as well as having held numerous Teaching Assistant placements.  During these placements I volunteered to assist in setting up lab resources; I also maintained server updates, user accounts, etc.
	
	I would appreciate an opportunity to further discuss my qualifications at your earliest convenience.  You may reach me via email at \href{mailto:richard.drake@uoit.ca}{richard.drake@uoit.ca}, or by phone at 905.442.3152. Thank you for your time.
	
	%I believe I am unique in that I am intimately familiar with the curriculum, laboratory setup, as well as pain points.
